# Animal Image Classifier with Django Interface
--> Overview
This project leverages a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) model to predict the names of animals based on provided images. The model, built using TensorFlow and Keras, has been trained on a diverse dataset to recognize a variety of animals.

--> Features
Interactive Django Interface: A user-friendly web interface powered by Django allows users to upload images and receive real-time predictions on the animal species.

State-of-the-Art CNN Model: The image classification is performed by a deep learning model implemented with TensorFlow and Keras, achieving high accuracy in identifying animals.

Integration with scikit-learn: The project utilizes scikit-learn for additional data preprocessing, evaluation metrics, and enhancing the overall machine learning pipeline.
